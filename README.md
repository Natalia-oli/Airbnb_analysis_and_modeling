# Airbnb 
Airbnb is a renowned platform that allows homeowners and apartment owners to offer their properties for short-term stays to guests. With its convenience and flexibility, it has become a preferred option among travelers. In this article, we will delve into the Airbnb Seattle dataset and address three key business questions mentioned below: <br/>
Q1: In which months does price variation usually occur? and at what times do prices remain constant?<br/>
Q2: Where are most of the accommodations concentrated in price variations? <br/>
Q3: How well can we predict the type of cancellation policy for bookings?
